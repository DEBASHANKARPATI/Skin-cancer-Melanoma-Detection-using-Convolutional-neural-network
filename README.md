## General Information
- This is a image classification project where we build a convolutional neural network model , which classifies the images of different kinds of skin cancers to automate the task of an oncologist.
- The data set is provided by  International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) , i have attached a link in the Datastlink.txt file in the project.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- This is most likely a learning project which helps to grasp the concept of CNN and how to deal with various problems while building the model for image classification.
- Here i learned how to improve model performance using dropout layers and class balancing techniques where we can augment the dataset .
